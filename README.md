# Monetate Redux SDK Sample
This project is used for demo and test purposes.
It takes advantage of **Monetate State Store Integration SDK** (https://github.com/monetate/monetate-state-store-integration-sdk)

It is about integration of Monetate's State Store Integration SDK logic with this React sample.
The idea is in tracking client's (browser's) events on the page and saving info in Redux store in the app.

## Setup
1. Run **yarn** from the project root
2. Run **yarn start** to start the dev server
